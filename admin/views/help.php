		<h2>Why do you need API key?</h2>
		<p>Each time you use the Google Maps APIs you must include a key to validate your request. If you can identify the source of a request positively, it acts as a form of authentication, which can lead to access control. These are more secure techniques for positively identifying the source of a request, and additionally, for protecting the request's content from snooping. <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#using-google-maps-apis">Learn more about Google API key.</a></p>
